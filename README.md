# Caerllion.Light
Simple in-process messaging system (message bus)

## Idea
* it shall be a simple library and not a framework
* it shall allow to register with a execution context (?)
* it shall support Pub-Sub and RPC
* it shall not enforce a lifecycle but allow to integrate into another framework
* it shall support registering custom handlers (?)
